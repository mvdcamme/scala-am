All files in this and underlying folders are taken from https://github.com/uim/sigscheme/tree/master/bench (2017-04-11).

Added/adapted tests to some files. Tests should normally evaluate to #t.
* takr.scm should return 7.
* loop.scm should evaluate to 8000.
* let-loop.scm should return 20000.
* arithint.scm should evaluate to 20001.

Some similar benchmarks were already included in SCALA-AM's test suite and are not included again.
* fib.scm
* cpstak.scm
