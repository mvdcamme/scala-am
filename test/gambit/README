Adapted tests in some files. Tests should normally evaluate to #t.
* browse.scm should evaluate to 1101.

Additional remarks
* cat.scm       =>  Some necessary files are not included in the test directory yet, but the test would fail inevitably because of other reasons.
* slatex.scm    =>  Some necessary files are not included in the test directory yet, but the test would fail inevitably because of other reasons.
* tail.scm      =>  Some necessary files are not included in the test directory yet, but the test would fail inevitably because of other reasons.
* wc.scm        =>  Some necessary files are not included in the test directory yet, but the test would fail inevitably because of other reasons.
