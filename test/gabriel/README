This directory includes the Gabriel benchmarks, retrieved from http://www.larcenists.org/Twobit/benchmarksAbout.html

Some benchmarks are slightly (or not-so-slightly) modified:
  - added definitions of some Scheme primitives (e.g., assq, member)
  - only run the benchmark for a single iteration, or run on smaller input
  - defines might be desugared to letrecs
  - cond desugared to ifs
